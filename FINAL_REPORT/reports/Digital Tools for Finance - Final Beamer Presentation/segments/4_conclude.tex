\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{exampleblock}{}
 To assume that there is an easy and time-independent asset to hedge cryp-
tocurrencies is too simple. 
    \end{exampleblock}
        \begin{exampleblock}{}
    The tremendous total return of cryptocurrencies over the considered period
makes it difficult to obtain an improved Sharpe Ratio when a hedge is introduced.  
    \end{exampleblock}
        \begin{exampleblock}{}
The opportunity costs
of not being fully invested in cryptocurrencies is simply too high. For our dataset, any non-crypto
addition resulted in a lower Sharpe Ratio. This means that a constant allocation doesnâ€™t seem to pay off.
